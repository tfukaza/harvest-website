# config

The `config` method is used to initialize the `interval`, `aggregations` and `watchlist` member variables of the `Algorithm` class.
Users are expected to override this method in their custom algorithm classes to set these member variables to their desired values.
See the [Algorithm](../Algorithm/index.md) documentation for more information on these member variables.

## Syntax
```python
def config(self)
```
Users are expected extend the `Algorithm` class to create their own custom algorithms. 
In the extended class, users should override the `config` method to set the `interval`, `aggregations` and `watchlist` member variables. 

## Example

```python
class MyAlgorithm(Algorithm):
    def config(self):
        self.interval = "5MIN"
        self.aggregations = ["15MIN", "30MIN", "1DAY"]
        self.watchlist = ["AAPL", "@BTC"]
```
