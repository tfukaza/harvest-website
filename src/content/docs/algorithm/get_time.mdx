# get_time

Returns the current hour and minute.

This returns the current time, which is different from the timestamp of stock prices. For example, if you are running an algorithm every 5 minutes, at 11:30am you will get price data with a timestamp of 11:25am. This function will return 11:30am.

## Syntax

<DocParameterTable params={[]} />

```python
def get_time(self):
```

## Returns

Returns the current time as a datetime object.

## Raises
- An `Exception` is raised if there is an error retrieving the time.
