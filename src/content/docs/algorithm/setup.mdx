# setup

Method called immediately prior to the algorithm starting.
This should be used to set up any initial state or perform any initial operations before the algorithm starts running.

## Syntax
```python
def setup(self)
```
Users are expected extend the `Algorithm` class to create their own custom algorithms. 
In the extended class, override the `setup` method to set up any initial state or perform any initial operations before the algorithm starts running. 
For example, if your algorithm uses a some state variables or relies on an external API, 
this would be a good place to initialize them.

## Example
```python
class MyAlgorithm(Algorithm):
    def setup(self):
        self.state = {"count": 0}
        self.api = MyAPI()
        self.api.connect()
```
