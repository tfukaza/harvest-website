# set_symbol

Specifies the symbol(s) to watch.

Cryptocurrencies should be prepended with an `@` to differentiate them from stocks. For example, '@ETH' will refer to Ethereum, while 'ETH' will refer to Ethan Allen Interiors. If this method was previously called, the symbols specified earlier will be replaced with the new symbols.

## Syntax

<DocParameterTable params={[
    {'field': 'symbol', 'type': 'Union[List[str], str]', 'description': 'Ticker Symbol(s) of stock or cryptocurrency to watch. It can either be a string, or a list of strings'},
]} />

```python
def set_symbol(self, symbol: Union[List[str], str]) -> None:
```

## Returns

This method does not return anything.

## Raises
- An `Exception` is raised if there is an error setting the symbol(s).
