# start

This method begins streaming data from the Broker.

The default implementation below is for polling the API. If a brokerage provides a streaming API, this method should be overridden to use the streaming API. Make sure to call `self.step()` in the overridden method.

## Syntax

<DocParameterTable params={[]} />

```python
def start(self) -> None:
```

## Returns

This method does not return anything.

## Raises
- An `Exception` is raised if there is an error starting the data streaming.
