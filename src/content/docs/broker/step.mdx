# step

This method is called at the interval specified by the user. It should create a dictionary where each key is the symbol for an asset, and the value is the corresponding data in the following pandas dataframe format:

```
                  [TICKER]
                  open   high    low close   volume
    timestamp
    ---       ---    ---     --- ---     ---
```

Timestamp should be an offset-aware datetime object in UTC timezone.

The dictionary should be passed to the trader by calling `self.broker_hub_cb()`.

## Syntax

<DocParameterTable params={[]} />

```python
def step(self) -> None:
```

## Returns

This method does not return anything.

## Raises
