# Starter Guide

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will code an algorithm that trades stocks using the moving average crossover strategy. 
As a practice, we will be paper (fake) trading using using fake data. 
We also won't be covering the pyHarvest library or the moving average crossover strategy in depth - instead, 
the focus is to give a crash course on getting pyHarvest up and running.
    
## What You Need
- Python 3.9 or newer

...that's it! Ideally though, you should also take some time to 
set up a virtual environments and version control systems using tools 
like `pyenv` and `virtualenv`. If you're not familiar with these tools,
check out the tutorials like [this](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)
and [this](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).


## Installing
First things first, let's install the library. 

```bash
pip install harvest-python
```

<Admonition type="warning">
    <p>There are some similar-sounding libraries out there, like `pyharvester` and `python-harvest`. Make sure you are installing the correct library by checking the name.</p>

## The Code
Once you have everything installed, we are ready to begin writing the code. 
For this guide we will be using pyHarvest's built-in dummy broker, 
which provides fake data for you to practice with.

Create a file called `algo.py` and begin coding in it. We begin by importing the necessary modules:

```python
from harvest import Algorithm
from harvest import CentralHub
from harvest.broker.dummy import DummyBroker
from harvest.broker.paper import PaperBroker
```

Next we start writing out algorithm. Algorithms are created by extending the `Algorithm` class. 

```python
class MyAlgo(Algorithm):
    pass
```

There are three methods in the Algo class that you can define. 
- `config`: Method to initialize parameters for your algorithm.
- `setup`: Method called right before the algorithm starts. We won't be using this for this tutorial.
- `main`: Method that runs the main logic of the algorithm.

We first define the config method.

```python
class MyAlgo(Algorithm):
    def config(self):
        self.watchlist=["SPY"]
        self.interval="5MIN"
```

`watchlist` is a list of stock symbols we want to track. 
In this example, we are tracking a single stock - SPY.

`interval` specifies the rate we want to run the algorithm at. 
For this algorithm, we arbitrarily decide to check Twitter 
stock prices every `5MIN`.

---

Next we define the actual logic. In short, the moving average crossover strategy works by calculating 
the average value of the stock over a certain period of time - one for a relatively short period, and another much longer. 
This strategy states that when the value of the shorter average crosses below the longer average it is a buy, 
and when it crosses over it's a sell. So we first need to calculate the two averages. 
This can be done by calling `Algorithm` class's `sma` function. 
We pass in the `period` parameter to specify how to calculate the average.

```python
    def main(self):
        short_avg = self.sma(period=20)
        long_avg = self.sma(period=50)
```

`sma` returns a list of the SMA values. Now we need to check if the latest values in the two lists cross over. 
For example, if short_avg is `[20,30,40]` and long_avg is `[30,31,32]`, then we need to trigger a sell. 
Lucky for you, pyHarvest comes with a method to do just this - `crossover()`! 
This returns True if the first list just crossed over the second list. 

```python
    def main(self):
        short_avg = self.sma(period=20)
        long_avg = self.sma(period=50)
        if self.crossover(short_avg, long_avg):
            self.sell()
        elif self.crossover(long_avg, short_avg):
            self.buy()
```

The `buy` and `sell` methods are pretty self-explanatory. 
When `buy` is called without any parameters, it will take the first stock in the watchlist (SPY) and buy as many as it can. 
Likewise, `sell` will sell all owned stocks of the first stock in watchlist. 

---

Finally, we create an instance of the trader class to use this algorithm, and run it. 

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hub = CentralHub( DummyBroker(), PaperBroker() )
```

This creates the `CentralHub` class, which is the main class that runs the algorithm.
In the instantiation, we pass in the broker we want to use.
We use the `DummyBroker` class as the fake data source, and the `PaperBroker` class as the broker to execute practice trades.

Lastly, we specify an instance of the `MyAlgo` class to the trader,
and run it.

```python
    hub.set_algo(MyAlgo())
    hub.run()
```

Below is the final code after putting everything together.

```python
from harvest import Algorithm
from harvest import CentralHub
from harvest.broker.dummy import DummyBroker
from harvest.broker.paper import PaperBroker

class MyAlgo(Algorithm):
    
    def config(self):
        self.watchlist=["SPY"]
        self.interval="5MIN"

    def main(self):
        short_avg = self.sma(period=20)
        long_avg = self.sma(period=50)
        if self.crossover(short_avg, long_avg):
            self.sell()
        elif self.crossover(long_avg, short_avg):
            self.buy()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hub = CentralHub( DummyBroker(), PaperBroker() )
    hub.set_algo(MyAlgo())
    hub.run()
```

You can now run your code:
```bash
python algo.py
```

## Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ 

You've made a fully functioning (albeit practice) trading bot!
That's it for the basics, but it's highly recommnded you also check out 
other tutorials for more advanced topics.
